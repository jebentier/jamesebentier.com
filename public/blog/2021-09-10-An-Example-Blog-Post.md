You know there are some tough parts to writing blog posts. Not knowing where to start, not knowing where to stop, how long should the be, the questions and concerns are endless.  So this is my first example blog post to be a guide for all those answers.

## Where to start?
Well, to start, the best thing to do is pick a topic. Not one that you don't know very well, or one that you just heard about. But one that you are truly passionate about. When you have passion about a topic, it comes out in your writing and will be present for all the readers to witness and feel themselves.

## Where to end?
Every post needs to come to an end. So just end it. There's no need to put everything in a single post or make things super short to stretch it out. Write until you have nothing more to say.

## What's the ideal lenght?
Goldilocks is a real thing. Not to hot, and not to cold, but in this case, short or long. Roughly 10-15mins is an ideal read for blog posts. But that is not an exact science and different topics have different ideals. The best thing is to track engagement and find your own equation.

## Do I need to polish away all the grammar and spelling mistakes?
Absolutely not. These are blogs, not official artiicles. As long as it's understandable, it's good to go. (You can also edit it later)

Welp, there you have it. This is my version of an example blog post. I hope you enjoyed it.
